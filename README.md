# CS230---Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room would like to create a application called “Draw It or Lose It” that is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Instead of players drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle, the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each and the drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. A game will have the ability to have one or more teams and each team will have multiple players assigned to it. Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing the team’s name and only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Thinking through the design constraints, system architecture view, and domain model helped me come up with an evaluation and recommendation on this project. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Having a reference to turn to when tieing the code together was helpful.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

THe memory managemet of the actual game

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Making sure that the game would run on client side regardless of their operating platform was a major key in designing the game. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
